# Express_local_library_app
 
This is my learning series on Node.js and Express. I've followed Express tutorial of MDN and made this app.
Some lines of code and variable names has been changed by me. I just want to make it more myselft and learn Node.js and Express from this tutorial,
even source code is not developed or implemented by myself.
